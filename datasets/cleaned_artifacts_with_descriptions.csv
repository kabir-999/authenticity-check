This unusually large pitcher, probably made in Manises, the principal center of Spanish lusterware throughout the fifteenth century, holds almost eight quarts, and is a rare example of earthenware technique. Although pitchers were common items of tableware, this particular example, when full, would have been much too heavy to wield conveniently. It therefore might have been used for dispensing wine or water to smaller table pitchers, or for serving wine at large banquets. Its large size and ornamentation have also made it a valuable decorative piece, which perhaps explains its fine state of preservation. The decoration, which includes patterns of pseudo-Kufic script, points to the Muslim origin of all Spanish lusterware. The technique, which originated in the Near East, found its way into Andalusia by the tenth century. By the fifteenth century, piracy and the wars with the Christians had prompted many craftsmen to move northward into the region of Valencia, where all artisans, whether Muslims, Mudejares (Muslims living under a Christian king), or Christians, were allowed to work, and where ships sailed freely to their Mediterranean markets, unhindered by pirates.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/471799/947772/main-image,Authentic

This stained glass panel features Saint Michael in armor and was on display in the galleries of the Department of Arms and Armor for many years. Granscay explained the rationale for doing this, in reference to medieval armor, in an article published in 1928: ""Contemporary representations often show more detail than extant armor, which has been injured by rust and the loss of elements.

Fauchard of the Bodyguard of Cardinal Scipione Borghese-Caffarelli (1576–1633),ca. 1600–1610,Italian,"Steel, copper, gold, silver, wood, textile",L. 113 3/4 in. (288.93 cm),Shafted Weapons,54.46.16,"The blade on this fauchard is very similar to another staff weapon in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 14.25.273), but this example is without the pierced rosettes. Except for the tip and the cutting edge, the blade is decorated similarly on both sides with a series of medallions and ornamental strapwork cartouches outlined in silver-encrusted dots and set against a blued background finely damascened with gold scrolls. The ornament within the medallions and cartouches is chiseled and gilt on a punched background and includes, from top to bottom, a grotesque, the papal tiara and crossed keys of Saint Peter, three palm branches projecting through a crown, a basilisk, the Borghese arms (a dragon displayed, on a chief an eagle displayed) surmounted by an archbishop's hat with ten tassels, an eagle, and a grotesque. The side straps and their rivets are decorated with punched and gilt ornament to match the blade and its socket. A tassel of silver-colored thread is mounted at the base of the socket. The octagonal wooden shaft is covered with red velvet and studded with copper rivets, and terminates in a sharp iron point.This example, one of two bearing the Borghese arms in the Metropolitan Museum, is surely one of the most elaborate and beautiful staff weapons ever produced, and combines all known techniques of metal decoration: bluing, gilding, engraving, and damascening, as well as encrustation with gold and silver. The owner of these staff weapons has traditionally been identified as Camillo Borghese (1552–1621), who became a cardinal in 1596 and who was elected to the papacy (as Paul V) in 1605. More recently, however, Boccia and Coelho have suggested that the owner may have been Cardinal Scipione Borghese-Caffarelli, a nephew of Paul V who was adopted into the Borghese family. Thirteen of these staff weapons remained in the Villa Borghese in Rome until 1892–93, when its contents were dispersed. A backplate for a child's armor decorated in the same technique and with the same motifs, which surely comes from the same workshop as these fauchards, is in the Kienbusch Collection in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/24831/1362930/main-image,Authentic

It was the most versatile of shafted weapons a man on foot could use; though the pike was the main weapon for the massed squares of foot soldiers so important in fifteenth- and sixteenth- century battles, the halberd was preferred both by SwissReisläuferand GermanLandsknecht(mercenaries). It had the advantage that it could be used in a pinch by a single man, such as when ambushed on a foraging or plundering raid, while a twelve-foot-long pike was of use only by soldiers in massed formation, and for a single man was more of a hindrance.In the formal development of the halberd, the offset socket pointing to the rear, as in this example, indicates a date before the middle of the sixteenth century.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/25898/1413372/main-image,Authentic

It bears two marks: a hunting horn in a shield, and a pine cone (the control mark of the city of Augsburg). The wheellock has a spring-closed pan cover with release button, and safety catch. The cock is chiseled with a stylized dragon.The ebonized stock is inlaid with staghorn engraved with stylized foliage and geometric patterns, two crowned heads on the grip, and two creatures with human heads on the left side. The incisions were blackened to make the design stand out.After the wheellock ignition mechanism was devised around 1500, it was first applied to firearms used on horseback. In fact the appearance of pistols––weapons handled with one hand––was due to the invention of the wheellock, and by the middle of the sixteenth century they became part of the equipment of middle and light cavalry, not just weapons available exclusively to men of high rank as had initially been the case. Since an ordinary pistol could deliver only one shot and had to be reloaded to fire the next round, pistols were commonly made in pairs and carried in leather holsters, one on each side of the saddle. A large ball-shaped pommel on the pistol grip made it easier to retrieve from the holster and also helped to conterbalance a heavy barrel.The city of Augsburg was one of the foremost arms-producing centers in Europe, and its armorers were among the first to produce wheellock pistols and carbines. Since wheellock firearms were fairly expensive, even pistols of military type, as represented by this example, rarely left the gunmaker's shop undecorated. The preferred decorative technique of German stockmakers from the sixteenth century on was the inlay of engraved staghorn plaques into the wood. Apart from the simple decorative effects of contrasting materials, use of staghorn inlays also reinforced the wooden stock, which was particularly vulnerable to the rough use of military firearms.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/27308/1870152/main-image,Authentic

Gold snuffboxes and boxes decorated with portrait miniatures were prized and frequently given as royal gifts, often to ambassadors or members of the court in lieu of cash payments for their services. Coveted and admired, these boxes were produced from a variety of materials. The best were skillfully made of gold and embellished with diamonds, enameled decoration, lacquer, and other luxurious materials. By the middle of the century, the taking of snuff had become an entrenched social ritual, and the snuffbox, too, had become an important social prop. Snuffboxes were considered highly fashionable accessories, with some merchants advertising new boxes with each change of season. The popularity of snuffboxes extended to all levels of society, and for those who could not afford gold, boxes were produced in less expensive materials such as silver, tortoiseshell, porcelain, or domestically produced lacquer.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/193973/434832/main-image,Authentic

Although characterized as more provincial in style than porcelain, French faience was used at the court of Louis XIV as part of elaborate meals and displays, with large-scale vessels incorporated into the Baroque garden designs of Versailles. Earlier examples of French faience attest to the strong influence of maiolica artists from Italy. Later works demonstrate the ways in which cities such as Nevers, Rouen, Lyon, Moustiers, and Marseille developed innovative vessel shapes and decorative motifs prized among collectors throughout Europe.While faience can be created from a wide mixture of clays, it is foremost distinguished by the milky opaque white color achieved by the addition of tin oxide to the glaze. French faience is typically divided into two types. Grand feu (high fire) describes pieces that have been decorated with glaze and metallic oxides before being fired a single time at a high temperature of around 1650°F (900°C). Petit feu (low-fire) faience, developed in the second half of the eighteenth century, refers to a process whereby the clay body is fired before being glazed and decorated with metallic oxides and then fired again at a lower temperature; pieces can also go through a third firing. Grand feu pieces have a more limited color palette that consists of blue, yellow, brown-purple, and green. By contrast, the lower firing temperature of petit feu faience enabled both greater precision in painting techniques and variety in the range of colors.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/194427/1741149/main-image,Authentic

Community Power Figure: Male (Nkisi),19th–20th century,Songye peoples,"Wood, copper, brass, iron, fiber, snakeskin, leather, fur, feathers, mud, resin",H. 39 × W. 10 1/2 × D. 11 in. (99.1 × 26.7 × 27.9 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1978.409,"This imposing standing male figure, about half life size, is the joint creation of a skilled carver and a trained ritual practitioner, ornganga(pl.banganga). Across Central Africa, such ritual specialists are major patrons of such power objects. The sculptor has divided the body evenly in sections that define the head, torso, and legs. Each of these remains clearly visible despite the materials added by thengangato the wooden sculpture, whether attached to its surface, or embedded within.The face has sensitively rendered features, with semi-circular eyes closed under arched eyebrows that extend on either side towards the jaw lines. These give the face its distinctive V-shape, interrupted by the short horizontal line of the chin. A brass plate covers the length of the nose, and organic matter fills the mouth, obscuring details of the carving. An ensemble of feathers, hide, fur, and rope, forming an elaborate hairdo that cascades down to the shoulder at the back of the neck, conceals the top and back of the head. A heavy iron pendant in the shape of an agricultural tool, or hoe, adorns the long ringed neck. The body is a succession of articulated angular shapes, from the squared off shoulders and tubular arms to the side of the torso, to the protruding abdomen on either side of which the hands rest, and the telescoping cones forming the thighs and calves. The prominent navel is topped with fur and brass studs. The figure’s feet and circular base, carved from the same piece of wood as the rest of the figure, are wrapped in hide. Completing the figure’s visible paraphernalia are snakeskins that encircle the torso and pieces of rope attached at both wrists. The head, arms and torso show a dark and shiny patina while the legs’ tone is closer to the wood’s natural surface. This discrepancy in the sculpture’s overall surface treatment signals the loss of a skirt that would have originally covered the lower half of the body. When compared with the extant corpus of community-owned Songye power figures, ormankishi(sing.nkishi), to which this example belongs, it is unusually slender. Its fully-defined legs stand out in a corpus where stocky lower limbs predominate. In absence of collecting data for this example, and based on specialist François Neyt’s 2009 survey of regional styles based on visual analysis, this example relates stylistically to the Songye central region, located around and south of Kalebwe.Large-scale power figures such as this example were central to the life of Songye communities spread over a vast territory in east-central Democratic Republic of the Congo, between the Sankuru and Lubilash rivers in the west and the Lualaba in the east. Acting as intercessors between ancestral spirits and the living,minkishiwere intended to benefit the entire community and were not the property of a single individual. The creation of ankishiwas a public event (Petridis 2009: 85) that brought together the community, a skilled carver and experiencednganga. Chiefs and elders commissioned thenkishiand the community was responsible for cutting the tree selected for the carving. Both the carver and thengangahad to be well established in their respective professions. The latter decided on thenkishi’s features and type of wood to be used, often selected for its curative or toxic properties or for being associated with certain ancestral contexts (Hersak 2010:44). Once the wooden form was carved following standardized protocols, thengangaassembled thebishimba, powerful matter made of animal, plant, and mineral substances. The addition of this sacred matter allowed thenkishito become a conduit for spiritual forces. According to anthropologist and Songye art specialist Dunja Hersak, and based on her 1970s fieldwork in the region, thengangawas responsible for “bring[ing] the spirit forces into play with the physical world” (Hersak 1986: 118) and was considered the true creator of thenkishi.Once completed, thenkishiwas kept in a special enclosure positioned in a highly visible location, such as the center of the village or near the chief’s house. It was cared for by a guardian who also served as an interpreter for thenkishiwhose messages were received through dreams or spirit possession. Collective consultations occurred following specific dreams or nightmares, and recurrently during celebrations related to the appearance of the new moon – an essential symbol of new life, fertility, and wealth associated with the human life-cycle. On those occasions, thenkishiwas taken out of its enclosure to be recharged by the moon’s life-force. It was sprinkled with the blood of a sacrificed chicken and anointed with palm oil, giving it its distinctive shiny patina. It was carried in procession through the village but could not be touched due to its great potency: instead, wooden poles attached under its arms with raffia strings had to be used. In the Met’s example, the raffia strings attached around the figure’s wrists are all that remains of this means of manipulation.Spirits of the dead, whether benevolent or malevolent, were thought to interfere in individuals’ daily affairs.Mankishiwere used for a community’s well-being, assuring fertility, protecting against illnesses, and generally keeping malevolent forces at bay. Their commissioning reflected a fear that disruptive forces would damage the village’s unity. Hersak states thatmankishi“provided the assurance of continuity and oneness in the context of drastic population decrease and disintegration of large-scale chiefships during the last three decades of the 19th century” (Hersak 2010: 41). They represented a collective identity and could survive generations. Communalmankishiwere given honorific names and their existence was remembered well after they ceased to be used. They eventually served as markers of time, as civic events came to be associated with the period of a specificnkishi’s activity.While significant political differences exist among the Songye groups, they are related to the neighboring Luba and like them, share the belief in a founding culture hero. Songye chiefs are considered to be his sacred heirs and two activities hold special status in connection with this mythical figure: hunting and blacksmithing (Hersak 2010: 42). Both are often referred to in the dress and accessories ofmankishi, as can be seen in the Met example, through the inclusion of animal paraphernalia such as feathers, fur, and snakeskins on one hand, and of the large forged iron pendant and brass ornaments on the other. In addition, in reference to the type ofbishimba-filled protective objects (especially horns, calabashes or diminutive carved figures) often worn by hunters, blacksmiths, chiefs andbangangathemselves, such powerful devices often enhancemankishias well (Hersak 1986: 120). Furthermore, attributes such as the elaborate headdress and raffia skirt, which the Metnkishiwould have originally worn, are distinctive traits of leadership. It appears that these heroic images could be characterized as both power figures and ancestor figures, underlining their combined political and religious significance (Petridis 2009: 88).Duality and opposition are at the core of ankishi’s physical representation and function. Their human appearance and visible attributes of chieftaincy are juxtaposed with animal characteristics that emphasize their non-human otherness (Hersak 2010: 42). Thebishimbaostentatiously packed in the mouth and navel of the Met figure give the impression that it is overflowing with mystical power. The snake belts that encircle the figure’s torso are meant to tie up and protect the inner body essence (Hersak 2010: 44). X-rays reveal that hidden under the fur and feather hairdo is a large animal horn filled with what is likely medicinal matter; two-third of it is buried into the head, point down. Its concealed presence reinforces the figure’s wild potency. Analysis further reveals hidden channels running inwards from the ears all the way to the tip of the embedded horn, as well as the presence of a filled inner cavity in the figure’s abdomen. Hidden by the fur that covers the navel, a long iron nail is embedded within and extends through the entire cavity (personal communication with conservators Ellen Howe and Caitlin Mahony, March 2018). These heroic images are highly visible but call upon secret knowledge, are both cultural construct and non-human entity, and are simultaneously characterized by openness and inwardness. Their materiality, function, and symbolic significance all attest to their complex and dual nature.Yaëlle Biro, 2018Further readingHersak, Dunja. 1986. Songye. Masks and Figure Sculpture.

Among the Mossi of Burkina Faso, a wooden face mask surmounted by a female figure appears at the funerals of revered women. The mask honors a woman whose great age, wisdom, and experience elevated her to the rank of a living ancestress, an ideal intermediary between the living and the spirits of the family's ancestors. In this work the artist has depicted such a woman at the height of her physical beauty, her youthful body adorned with the scarification patterns traditionally applied after the birth of her first child. The crescent-shaped coiffure, metal armlets, and pierced ears (which once held metal or beaded earrings) further enhance the beauty of the figure and reflect Mossi ideals of personal embellishment.The stylized oval face mask, with its central vertical ridge, indicates an origin in the Yatenga region. Mossi masks from this area resemble the masking styles of the Dogon of Mali and reflect their shared history. Five centuries ago, when the Mossi states were founded, some Dogon living in this area were assimilated into Mossi society, while others fled to the present home of the Dogon around the Bandiagara cliffs.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/312288/666913/restricted,Authentic

Such masks were worn by virtuosic male performers of a stilt dance called ""mukudj,"" which involved towering impressively while executing complex choreography and astonishing feats of acrobatics.The creator of a ""mukudj"" mask would attempt to capture the likeness of the most beautiful woman in his community. The subject of this particular idealized and stylized portrait was embellished in classic nineteenth-century fashion with a coiffure composed of a central lobe and two lateral tresses and with cicatrization motifs on the forehead and temples. Kaolin taken from riverbeds, which was associated with healing and with a spiritual, ancestral realm of existence, was applied to the surface of the face.

Couple,17th–late 18th century,Sakalava peoples,"Wood, pigment",H. 39 × W. 11 × D. 6 3/8 in. (99.1 × 27.9 × 16.2 cm),Wood-Sculpture,2001.408,"This Madagascar couple ranks as the foremost artistic achievement of a region where African and Pacific Island influences meet. It was created by a Sakalava artist in western Madagascar to grace the pinnacle of a ""hazomanga,"" a tall wooden monument set in a place of honor near the house of a clan elder. It constituted the focal point for prayers, sacrifices, and boys' circumcision ceremonies. Measuring around six feet in height, the hazomanga was a striking element of the architectural landscape and a potent reminder of kinship, both past and present.Set side by side, these figures engage the viewer with their intense expressions and deeply recessed eyes. Their subtle stylization simultaneously unifies them and amplifies what makes them different, producing an eloquent statement on the fundamental complementarity of man and woman. As the centerpiece of circumcision rights performed to promote the virility of each generation, the couple emphasizes the importance of the male-female partnership in assuring the community's future. The figures' nudity, striking in a region where textiles are a fundamental element of identity, serves to further underscore these timeless and universal themes of fertility and regeneration.The work's quiet power and lyrically balanced symmetry helped it to become one of the rare examples of southeast African sculpture to have influenced Western art.

Lidded Vessel,19th century,North Nguni peoples,Wood,H. 24 13/16 × W. 17 × W. 17 in. (63 × 43.2 × 43.2 cm),Wood-Containers,"2013.165a, b","This four-legged vessel, carved from a single piece of wood with a separate cover, can be considered an Nguni master sculptor’s tour de force, primarily intended to dazzle and delight the viewer as a triumphant feat of woodcarving. The ovoid form of the container itself is supported by—and appears to float within—a pedestal superstructure with four square legs that has an anthropomorphic quality. The cover, surmounted by a large, rounded handle with knobs of wood at either side, completes the central oval form. The surface of both the vessel and cover has been filled with deeply incised lines of rounded and soft marks that run in close parallel lines, following the overall shape of the vessel. These lines of surface decoration are arranged into blocks that visually juxtapose verticals and horizontals, and they may be intended to emulate the appearance of woven fabric. The direction of the lines on the inner container are also mirrored on the outer support, increasing the sense of dimensionality. This dramatic decorative surface program is a distinctive characteristic of the works in this school of Nguni sculpture.The vessel is one of the largest and most significant in a defined corpus of related sculptures that have been attributed to a number of Zulu-speaking carvers, active in the mid-nineteenth century in the vicinity of the former British colony of Natal, in present day Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa (Catherine Elliot, personal correspondence, 11/04/18). The headrest (2018.356) is also considered part of this group. These craftspeople were regionally renowned for their skill in wood carving, and the sculptor responsible for this work would have produced carvings both for a local elite, such as the Zulu King Mpande kaSenzangakhona (r.1840–1872), and for a European clientele, an increasing presence at Port Natal from the 1820s onwards. Major works of sculpture by this group were first exhibited in Europe at world fairs such as the International Exhibition, held in London in 1862, which intended to showcase the fine arts of all nations following the example of the Great Exhibition of 1851. Here, a number of Nguni sculptures were showcased in the ‘Natal Court’ (Elliott, Cartwright and Kevin, 2013: 18).A contemporaneous inventory of the works on show was compiled by Dr. Robert James Mann (1817–1886). While Mann did not record the names of most of the sculptors, he did attribute an exceptional group of carved wooden objects to “a renowned artisan, named Unobadula” (Mann, 1862 [1]: 18). Works by this artist included a chair “carved out of one block of wood”, a headrest, and “three pots”. Two of these pots were described as having “pedestals” or supportive superstructures—much like this example—and are currently housed in the British Museum (Af.4876 and Af.4875). A photograph taken by Mann of “the wood-carver Unobadula” shows him holding what appears to be a double tiered vessel mounted on a pedestal with a surface of parallel lines (Elliot, Cartwright and Kevin, 2013: fig.5).About twelve large-scale covered vessels have been recorded in various museum collections. Alongside the examples in the British Museum, the Musée Quai Branly in Paris, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Natural History Museum in Lille all have important examples. In South Africa, the Brenthurst Collection at the Johannesburg Art Gallery features three important examples. It is unclear what they were used for. Early texts state that they were variously used for beer, known as “rhewu”, and also for milk and butter. According to Mann’s 1862 inventory: “Great potentates…have their beer brought to them in Wooden Pots.” He notes that because of the scale of the vessel, the drinker may have needed to have it lifted on his behalf (Mann cited in Elliot, Cartwright and Kevin, 2013: 19). Such vessels may also have functioned as large-scale tobacco or snuff containers, their monumental scale intended to impress visitors at court, where they might have been reserved for ceremonial occasions alone (Nettleton: 1996). The existence of a spoon with the example in Lille has been taken as an indication that these vessels may originally have been used for culinary purposes, such as containers for porridge.Analysis of the interior surfaces of the wood, however, has found no residue of substances that the vessel might once have contained (Ellen Howe, personal communication, 08/04/13). Indeed, very few traces of wear or usage exist across the whole corpus (Klopper, personal communication with Alisa LaGamma, 04/08/13). This lack of evident use indicates that the vessel may always have been intended as a stand-alone work of art rather than a functional container. These were either used by local potentates as prestige items, or exhibited at international exhibitions.James Green, Ph.D.The Sylvan C.

Sachihongo Mask,19th–early 20th century,Mbunda peoples,"Wood, pigment(?)",H. 17 × W. 12 × D. 10 in. (43.2 × 30.5 × 25.4 cm),Wood,2016.106,"Mbunda-styleSachihongomasks are characterized by their round shape, proportionally exaggerated features, and prominent brow ridge and cheeks. All the examples that survive date from no earlier than the late nineteenth through twentieth centuries and most have been entirely stripped of their costume elements. The sculptors responsible for these works were heavily influenced by neighboring Chokwe artists renowned for their play back and forth between realistic and bombastic exaggeration of different elements of the human physiognomy. This exceptional example is striking for its scale and the dramatic graphic emphasis given to the articulation of essential facial features. At the mid-point horizontal semi-circular voids denote the ocular apertures. These are emphatically framed by a series of concentric linear arcs. A series of three successive curves extend from the bridge of the nose to the temples defining the brows directly below a convex volumetric forehead. Directly below either eye successive arcs define pouches under each of these and the cheekbones. Centrally positioned is the raised ridge of the nose with flaring nostrils above a projecting rectilinear mouth. The open mouth features an upper row of individually defined teeth and a lower row that is less articulated.An array ofmakishimasquerades are performed at the end of initiation rites for young boys, ormukanda, celebrated by the Vaka Chiyama Cha Mukwamayi community of the Luvale, Chokwe, Luchazi and Mbunda peoples of Zambia. During a period of seclusion adolescent boys undergo circumcision and are instructed in qualities they are expected to take on as adult men. This mask form, known asSachihongo, is the only wood variety featured at the culmination of the celebration when the youth are brought back to the community. Although the practice was likely established far earlier, masked dances of the Mbunda were recorded by European observers beginning in the 1870s. In 2005 this performative tradition was added to the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage.Sachihongomost commonly represents the spirit of a cultural archetype — an ancestral hunter armed with a bow. The elevated status of the subject is such that it may also be addressed as an ancestral chief or diviner. A male dancer would have worn the mask along with a knit fiber costume, a skirt of palm leaves, and other accessories, including anklets.

(162.6 × 74.3 × 67.3 cm),Wood-Sculpture,2014.256,"This seat of office was created for a leader in the Grassfields region of western Cameroon. This densely populated region was a prosperous nexus of trade that gave rise to a proliferation of principalities. The powerful rulers of these wealthy city-states, who were responsible for the well-being of their people, became major patrons of the arts. They commissioned lavish palace complexes with sculptural programs, regalia for themselves and members of their courts, masquerades performed at civic celebrations, and, most important, the seat of office identified with their reign.This throne served as the visual focus of rites establishing the legitimate transfer of power as well as continuity in leadership. It was documented in Bansoa in 1957 by the French researcher Pierre Harter, who recorded the name of the late nineteenth-century ruler credited with its creation: Njouteu. The sculpture of a king and his consort standing at the back of a circular seat supported by a leopard was carved from a single piece of wood wrapped in a fine layer of locally woven fabric. Upon this three-dimensional canvas, a master beader applied thousands of glass beads—a luxury good created in Venice and Prague for export to this region of West Africa. The emphatic use of blue underscores the elite status of the subjects, who hold insignia of leadership: a buffalo- horn drinking vessel and a calabash receptacle for palm-wine offerings.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/635680/1338157/restricted,Authentic

The figure is depicted wearing a distinctive cross pendant. His wrap skirt is adorned with profile heads of Portuguese traders, a frontal African head, and other common Benin motifs such as river leaves, mudfish, and interlace patterns.Three different identities have been proposed for this figure. The official may be a messenger from a ruler referred to as the ""Ogane,"" who today is identified as the leader, or ""oni,"" of Ife. The present Benin dynasty claims descent from the Yoruba kingdom of Ife. According to a sixteenth-century Portuguese text, each new ""oba,"" or king, of Benin had to be confirmed by the ""Ogane,"" whose messenger presented the ""oba"" with a brass hat, staff, and cross necklace. Another interpretation suggests that he may represent a priest of Osanobua, the Benin creator god, who also wears a cross. Finally, the figure may depict a member of ""Ewua,"" a group of palace officials who wake the ""oba"" each morning and perform a ceremony recalling the origin of the Benin dynasty.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/316503/666923/main-image,Authentic
Sculptural Bust from a Reliquary Ensemble (The Great Bieri),19th century,Fang-Betsi,"Wood, copper alloy, palm oil",H. 18 5/16 x W. 9 3/4 x D. 6 5/8 in. (46.5 x 24.8 x 16.8 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1979.206.229,"In Fang society, figurative sculptures produced for the ancestor cult, or ""Bieri,"" were designed to complement reliquary containers. Such works were generalized ancestral representations which were memorialized and addressed in times of need through relics preserved in the attached container. This sculptural creation distills the representation of a larger-than-life ancestral presence to a head with a penetrating gaze. It was originally placed at the summit of a portable family altar that held precious relics of at least nine generations of an extended lineage. While the relics were accessible to only initiated family members, the sculptural element visually summarized the importance of the contents. The black of the wood was enlivened with applications of palm oil that preserved the sculpture and enhanced the play of light on the surface. Historically, Fang sculptors created free-standing heads, half-figures, and full-figures to be integrated intobierialtar ensembles.In 1962, reflecting upon the significance of this work, art historian Robert Goldwater observed, ""For every style and every period, in the history of the arts of mankind, a few works stand out above the rest. Somehow they both contain and surpass all these qualities which we value in the art of the culture from which they come. They seem to have captured the ideal of design and expression toward which many artists tended…The Great Bieriis such a work: it is the embodiment of Fang sculpture, and one of the great classics of African art.""This majestic work is among the most frequently reproduced works of African art. Its impact derives from its bold hierarchic presence, which has been rendered on a monumental scale. WhileThe Great Bieriis the largest of the known Fang heads, it is also the most formally succinct and pared down. Its author has masterfully distilled the genre to its essential elements through gently equilibrated curved lines. So that the astonishing breadth of the domed forehead does not overpower the narrow eroded chin, a band of hair extends at either side of the head. These vertical extensions are broadened and enlivened at successive intervals by the added features of the inverted C-shaped ears and two cylindrical rolls. A third, broader tress falls from the crown of the head down the back. The penetrating omniscient gaze is directed outward from the circular metallic disks of the eyes, framed by lightly incised curved brows; the vertical nose is squared at the base. On the inky black surface of the face, there are highlighted passages of oil residue. On the reverse side, areas of the patina have worn away to expose the underlying rich red-brown wood. The abrasion and wear at the base of the face, across the mouth and chin, occurred through ritual handling. A vertical split reaches from the summit to the chin.This icon has been a muse to artists both in the West and beyond since the early twentieth century. The first person to whom its ownership has been attributed was the Chilean poet and founder of theCreacionismomovement, Vicente Huidobro. In 1916 Huidobro settled in Paris, where he established contacts with such members of the avant-garde as the artists Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Francis Picabia, and Jacques Lipchitz and the writers Blaise Cendrars and Guillaume Apollinaire. He appears to have acquired this work shortly after his arrival in Paris and in 1918 was inspired to write the poemEcuatorial, dedicated to Picasso, which reflected this embrace of Cubism in poetic expression – and specifically of this work from equatorial Africa as his muse. Like his counterparts in the visual arts, Huidobro did not refer overtly to the imagery of the African sculptures he collected, but rather identified powerfully with what he saw as their ideal blending of representation and abstraction.Huidobro subsequently relinquished this epic creation to French art dealer Paul Guillaume, who in turn sold it to British-American artist Jacob Epstein by the late 1920s. Epstein recalls his earliest encounter with Guillaume: ""When I was in Paris in 1912, I saw an advertisement in a colonial paper asking for African carvings in hard wood. Calling at the address in Montmartre I met Paul Guillaume for the first time, in a small attic room. He started the vogue in African work."" Epstein’s collection was sold after his death in August 1959. Before its dispersal at auction, Goldwater acquired in 1961 four of the works for the Museum of Primitive Art in New York – a privately owned museum whose holdings were later transferred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and founded the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas.The Great Bieri’s formal qualities evoke one of Epstein’s statements concerning the eloquence of African sculpture: ""In much of the work there is real anatomic truth to be found, extremely simplified, and often expressed architecturally."" Epstein further comments on the keen powers of observation manifested in the heads carved by Fang masters: ""These heads are realistic works, obviously the result of a very minute study of nature. You can see the well-developed bony structure of the forehead, the sunken eyes, protruding jawbone and the flesh around the mouth and nose shrinking, as if to crumble away. They are burial symbols.""Further readingLaGamma, Alisa Ed. 2007Eternal Ancestors: The Art of the Central African Reliquary.New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven and London: Yale University Press.Perrois, Louis.Fang.

Headdress,19th–20th century,Ejagham peoples,"Wood, untanned animal skin, cane, metal (iron alloy), pigment",H. 11 in. × W. 6 1/2 in. × D. 8 in. (27.9 × 16.5 × 20.3 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1979.206.266,"Headdresses covered in leather, like this elegant depiction of a beautiful young woman with an elaborate coiffure and a white face, are created in the region along the Cross River in Nigeria and Cameroon. This particular example was made by the Ejagham peoples and is characteristic of a genre popular across the region. Some are startlingly naturalistic and may be portraits of known individuals; others are highly stylized. There are three overall types: helmet masks that cover the wearer's head entirely, masks that cover only the face, and headdresses that, like this one, are attached to basketry caps worn on top of the head.These exceptional works were owned by societies formed to provide their members entertainment and mutual assistance. Headdresses were named after and allied with the association for which they were commissioned. Members of associations are men or women of the same generation, and membership is often further restricted to those who have performed certain feats or are proficient in particular skills. In the past, for example, there were associations of hunters who had killed leopards or other dangerous animals. These societies might be further stratified into successive levels for which advancement was contingent on the paying of a certain fee.Headdresses were worn for both festive and important ceremonial occasions. Deaths of high-ranking society members would be marked by elaborate commemorative funerals at which the headdresses would be worn by an accomplished dancer dressed in a full length gown, adorned with the society's important paraphernalia, and accompanied by specific musical instruments.To make a headdress, the artist carves the form from a single piece of wood and covers it with soft untanned antelope skin that has been soaked in water for several days. He stretches, binds, and pegs the skin into place until it dries and stiffens. Eyes, scarifications, and hair are often carved separately and pegged into the finished piece. Before it is worn, the headdress is painted or colored, then adorned with porcupine quills, feathers, or feathered rods stuck into holes at the top.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/312460/666924/restricted,Authentic
Figure from a Reliquary Ensemble: Seated Female,19th–early 20th century,"Fang peoples, Okak group","Wood, metal",H. 25 3/16 x W. 7 7/8 x D. 6 1/2 in. (64 x 20 x 16.5 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1978.412.441,"The Fang peoples derive a sense of continuity with their past as well as a communal cohesiveness in the present through an ancestral cult known as bieri. Bieri reliquary figures, such as this 19th century example, embody the qualities that the Fang admire most in people—namely, tranquility, vitality, and the ability to hold opposites in balance. Such wooden figures and heads are placed on top of bark containers that hold the precious relics of important clan ancestors. The carved head or figure mounted on top of the reliquary box guards the sacred contents against the forbidden gaze of women and uninitiated boys. Before being removed from Africa, such works were invariably separated from the relic containers that they originally enhanced.This formidable female figure personifies controlled exuberance. Despite her contemplative expression, her being exudes vitality and boundless physical dynamism. The eyes are defined as deeply incised pupils within expansive recesses. These concave passages are echoed in the round at the summit of the forehead by the bold globular projections of the coiffure elements. This regal and original arrangement of hair is highly detailed. Several contiguous crests extend across the crown of the head and are gathered in a single vertical tress at the nape of the neck.The Fang sculptor, who lucidly articulated this figure as a series of discrete component elements, integrated them masterfully into a seamless form to stunning effect. The pronounced ovoid volume of the head is abruptly juxtaposed with the broad columnar neck. At the outer corner of each eye a deep arc extends to the bridge of the nose. The nostrils are slightly flared, and the open mouth is cast as a broad oval. Especially alluring is the effect of the shimmering highlights that glance off the luminous midnight black wood, which is thoroughly saturated with oil. Another arresting visual accent is provided by the pendent oval breasts. These do not appear as sensuous elements but rather as overt attributes of power. Their formal definition complements the muscular curves of the physiognomy, so that they are echoed in the successively larger cylindrical units of the shoulders, upper arms, and fore-arms. The arms are bent at the elbows, hands held in front of the body in a pose suggesting arrested animation.Positioned as freestanding with slightly flexed knees, the figure appears to shift her weight slightly to the proper right side. The fact that she was originally conceived as seated is apparent from the extreme abbreviation of the powerful thighs, when seen frontally, in contrast to the full forms of the elongated calves. On the reverse side the vertical channel of the spine extends the length of the back and intersects with the horizontal passage of the buttocks. The original patrons sought to repair a break to the proper left shoulder b affixing horizontal metal bands with five nails to the front and reverse side. Two brass rings appear around the neck as well as one around the proper left wrist and each ankle.This work was owned successively by two members of the Western avant-garde, André Derain and Jacob Epstein. According to legend, Derain acquired his first work of African sculpture, a Fang mask, from his friend and close associated Maurice de Vlaminck. Around that time, he went to London and studied the ethnographic collections of the British Museum. That transforming experience led him to write Vlaminck of the ""amazing, disquieting"" impact of the works he encountered. Art historian Jack Flam has noted that despite this emotional response to African sculpture, Derain strove to grasp the key to its inherent formal logic.Flam has proposed that Vlaminck was principally drawn to and identified with African art’s instinctive expressive qualities. He has further noted that, although Vlaminck did not extensively appropriate the formal qualities of such works in his own painting, he was eager to establish his own seminal role in the avant-garde’s ""discovery"" of African art. By Vlaminck’s account, the experience that ignited his own interest occurred in a bistro in Argenteuil, while taking a break from painting outdoors. Three African artifacts on a shelf behind the bar caught his attention, and he acquired them in exchange for buying the house a round of drinks. Shortly afterwards, a friend of his father gave him three more works. Among these was a Fang mask that he hung in his bedroom. Upon seeing the mask, Derain asked to buy it from him, but Vlaminck initially refused. A few weeks later, in need of money, he relented and it entered Derain’s collection. According to Flam, these events, which may have occurred between 1903 and 1905, became the most frequently related narrative of the discovery of ""primitive art.""Vlaminck’s insistence on his role in instilling in his contemporaries, such as Matisse and Picasso, an awareness of African art’s aesthetic qualities is underscored in another account he disseminated. According to a version related by his biographer Francis Carco, Vlaminck showed an African sculpture to Derain and said that he found it to be ""almost as beautiful as the Venus de Milo."" Derain responded that it was in fact ""as beautiful as the Venus de Milo."" The two then showed it to Picasso, who reputedly deemed it ""more beautiful than the Venus de Milo.""Alisa LaGammaFurther ReadingLaGamma, Alisa, ed.Eternal Ancestors: The Art of the Central African Reliquary.

Surrounding the burial and commemoration of titleholders, these celebrations provide occasions for the masks to emerge from their guarded storerooms and to be danced before the entire population.

The slitted almond-shaped eyes are set in a concave diamond face within a recessed heart-shaped frame. The face is whitened with kaolin and framed by the curved arcs of a pair of animal horns that emerge from the crown of the head and meet at the base of the chin. Working with a seemingly flat representation, the artist has skillfully drawn upon the use of alternating negative and positive spaces and faceted surfaces.Known as ""ekuk"" or ""things of the forest"" this genre of mask act as intermediaries between the forest and the village. Additionally, the gentle curving horns of the ""bata"" mask are understood to be a metaphor for the cosmic unification of those two realms. Though their dance is characterized as human, ""ekuk"" have fantastical attributes: trunks, beaks, or horns. Often painted white, a color the Kwele associate with light and clarity the ""ekuk"" are portrayed as possessing the clairvoyance necessary to fight witchcraft.In Kwele villages rituals known as ""beete"" are enacted at times of crisis in order to mobilize the powers of the ancestors. The skulls of important deceased family members are preserved to combat the negative forces that threatened to destroy a community with famine, disease, or war.

Commemorative Post: Male (Ngya),late 19th century,Bongo,"Wood, paint(?)",H. 75 1/2 × W. (approx.)  9 1/2 × D. 9 1/4 in. (191.8 × 24.1 × 23.5 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1973.264,"The Bongo peoples of western South Sudan erect large wooden sculptures around the graves of important members of the community. These tall, polelike monuments take a simplified human form: a male figure that stands with flexed knees and, generally, arms held close to the body. The gentle modeling of the body and the sensitive treatment of the face and head give the piece a simple yet natural aesthetic. The eyes of this figure were originally accented with beads that have since been lost, leaving hollow cavities. Its arms are also missing, but holes indicate that the right arm was at one time reattached.It was common practice among the Bongo to honor high-ranking hunters and warriors by erecting these carved wooden effigies on their grave. It is not clear to what extent the effigies were supposed to resemble the deceased, but in at least a few cases, the sculptures do capture personal adornments such as bracelets and scarification patterns. During his lifetime, a Bongo man could gain honor and prestige through successfully hunting large animals or achieving victory in combat. In fact, some Bongo effigies are even notched to indicate the number of successful kills achieved by the deceased. The post was raised by the deceased's relatives usually a year or so after his death in a ceremony accompanied by a large feast. In addition to the central male figure, the grave site may also be decorated with sculptural representations of the deceased's wives, children, and even victims. The wooden monuments and feast confirm the title and rank attained by the deceased during his lifetime, and ensure that he maintains that place of distinction in the afterlife. The higher the deceased's status, the more lavish the celebration. During the festivities, relatives and guests recite his accomplishments and genealogy, so that Loma, the Bongo's Creator God, may evaluate him.This work was one of eleven Ngya commemorative posts collected in and around the town of Tonj, in South Sudan, in 1972. According to information gathered at the time of its acquisition, this particular work had served an unusual purpose: set up before 1914 in a market where commercial transactions between Bongo and Nuer populations took place, it was said to help keep trade relations harmonious. The sculpture was given the name of a Nuer ancestor, which has since, unfortunately, been lost. Its distinctive function and location in a sheltered environment explain its smooth and shiny surface, different from the weathered look that characterizes the rest of the corpus of Bongo sculptures. They were each carved from a single tree trunk of mahogany, an exceptionally dense and heavy wood with great durability property.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/309909/672534/main-image,Authentic
Queen Mother Pendant Mask: Iyoba,16th century,Edo,"Ivory, iron, brass, coal, pigment(?)",H. 9 3/8 x W. 5 x D. 2 1/2 in. (23.8 x 12.7 x 6.4 cm),Bone/Ivory-Sculpture,1978.412.323,"This ivory pendant mask is one of a pair of nearly identical works; its counterpart is in the British Museum in London. Although images of women are rare in Benin's courtly tradition, these two works have come to symbolize the legacy of a dynasty that continues to the present day. The pendant mask is believed to have been produced in the early sixteenth century for the King orObaEsigie, the king of Benin, to honor his mother, Idia. Theobamay have worn it at rites commemorating his mother, although today such pendants are worn at annual ceremonies of spiritual renewal and purification.In Benin, ivory is related to the color white, a symbol of ritual purity that is associated with Olokun, god of the sea. As the source of extraordinary wealth and fertility, Olokun is the spiritual counterpart of the oba. Ivory is central to the constellation of symbols surrounding Olokun and the oba. Not only is it white, but it is itself Benin's principle commercial commodity and it helped attract the Portuguese traders who also brought wealth to Benin.The mask is a sensitive, idealized portrait, depicting its subject with softly modeled features, bearing inlaid metal and carved scarification marks on the forehead, and wearing bands of coral beads below the chin. In the openwork tiara and collar are carved stylized mudfish and the bearded faces of Portuguese. Because they live both on land and in the water, mudfish represent the king's dual nature as human and divine. Having come from across the seas, the Portuguese were considered denizens of the spirit realm who brought wealth and power to the oba.The Legacy of Benin Court Art: From Tragedy to ResilienceAt its origins, the centralized city-state of Benin was founded by Edo-speaking peoples. The accounts by official court historians and descriptions provided by visitors evoke a vibrant cultural center continually redefined by its leadership through shifting internal and external power dynamics. According to oral tradition, circa 1300, Edo chiefs are reputed to have reached out to the leader of neighboring Ife, Oranmiyan, to establish a new divinely sanctioned royal dynasty. Since then, the investiture of Benin’s rulers to the title of obas has conferred upon them at once a role of chief priest officiating in important religious ceremonies and presiding over an elaborate structure of palace officials. During the fifteenth century reign of Oba Ewuare, Benin’s armies were formed and the fortification of its capital with a massive wall undertaken. In parallel, delegations of Portuguese traders assiduously sought to secure exclusive commercial treaties with this leader of the region’s most powerful polity. At its height in 1500, Benin’s authority extended to the Niger delta in the east and to the coastal lagoon of Lagos in the west. Its major exports of pepper, textiles, and ivory were exchanged for copious quantities of imported metals. This access to an influx of brass led to an explosion of creativity by court artists who transformed it into works for the palace ranging from ancestral portraits, positioned on royal altars, to decorative plaques depicting the oba, his courtiers, and foreign interlocutors. From the earliest such exchanges, those Europeans commissioned exquisite ivory artifacts from Edo carvers for princely collections back home.For nearly five hundred years, Benin’s independent leaders firmly established the terms of engagement with Portuguese, Dutch, and French agents and effectively represented their own interests. Despite the demands of the Atlantic Slave trade, for centuries they limited their participation to selling prisoners of war to the Portuguese. Historians have suggested that this only changed during the eighteenth century when escalation of contests among regional polities created a demand for access to European firearms. During that later period instability engendered by disputes over succession and civil war was further fueled through the exchange of captives for firearms. A number of internal and external developments that followed in the nineteenth century impacted the standing and vulnerability of Benin’s monarchs. Under Oba Adolo, the balance of power appears to have favored the more powerful chiefs and by the early years of his successor Ovonramwen’s reign, bitter feuds and seditious conspiracies divided their ranks. This shift was manifest in the increased emphasis on the oba’s ceremonial and ritual activities and the aggrandizement of chiefly residences that outstripped the palace. Concurrently significant changes were unfolding around Benin: Islam was in the ascendant in the rival state of Oyo; Christianity was embraced by the southern Yoruba; abolition of the slave trade was leading to the demise of the Itsekiri monarchy; and local British officials were increasingly determined to undermine the oba’s authority.The British invasion of the capital of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897 was part of a campaign waged from 1892 through 1902 to forcibly bring most of the inland territory of modern-day Nigeria under British rule. With the British conquest of Benin City, Oba Ovonramwen was exiled to Calabar and soldiers plundered the palace. The brutality of the removal of its contents has forever decoupled altars dedicated to each individual oba dating from 1300 to Benin’s conquest with the specific works conceived to commemorate them. Directly following the military action some 200 Benin artifacts were given to the British Museum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs while others were sold on the international art market. In addition to dealers and private collectors the major clientele at this time were newly established ethnographic museums in the West. Following Ovonramwen’s death in 1913, his son Eweka II was restored to the office within a British protectorate and prioritized a renewal of artistic patronage in Benin City. Subsequent to the nineteenth century dispersal of Benin works, awareness of their extraordinary aesthetic power, beauty, and complexity profoundly influenced Black public intellectuals. Notable among these in the U.S. were W.E.B. Dubois, Alain Locke and artists from the Harlem Renaissance on. At the same time, their relegation to ethnographic museums during the colonial era continues to reflect the legacy of their forceful removal and segregation from comparable cultural achievements by Western creators.In 1950 a selection of Benin works were transferred through sale, exchange, and donation from the British Museum to what is today Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments for display in Benin City and Lagos. In 1960 with the establishment of the Federation of Nigeria as a nation, Benin City became the capital of Edo State. Exemplars of this tradition today conserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were given to this institution in 1969 and 1991 by individuals who acquired them on the international art market to at once make them accessible to the public and celebrate their excellence. In 2016 Oba Ewuare II assumed the title of Benin’s current oba. He has noted that while such works ""have come to serve as ambassadors of our culture around the world,"" a priority is the building of a new museum devoted to this legacy in Benin City. Designed by David Adjaye, this major cultural initiative embedded in the very fabric of the ancient city walls promises to afford expanded opportunities to understand and reflect on the significance of this living tradition at its source as well as those for international collaboration.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/318622/674997/main-image,Authentic

Its crowning element is the distinctive mpu headdress worn by chiefs or priests. The figure's posture and gesture, leaning forward with hands placed akimbo on the hips, is the aggressive attitude of one who challenges fearlessly. Traces of a missing beard-a sign of seniority-survive in the form of nails along the contours of the chin. There are also vestiges of an abdominal cavity for medicinal matter that originally attracted the figure's defining force. The various metals embedded in the figure's expansive torso attest to its central role as witness and enforcer of affairs critical to its community.

It had close political ties to the Benin kingdom some seventy miles to the southeast. Much of Owo's courtly culture, including titles, costumes, and prestige sculpture, reflect a close association between the two important political and cultural centers.The vast and terrible powers of the ""olowo"" are expressed in the imagery of this work by four figural groups united by a python, an important symbol of royalty. Prominent and pervasive mudfish and crocodile motifs evoke the king's praise names, or ""oriki,"" that liken him to a vast ocean into which all rivers flow and whose unfathomable depths hold potent secrets and supernatural abilities.

Figure: Head,12th–15th century,Yoruba peoples,Soapstone,H. 11 1/4 in. × W. 5 1/2 in. × D. 6 in. (28.6 × 14 × 15.2 cm),Stone-Sculpture,1979.206.296,"This stone head of a woman is part of a group of over a thousand known sculptures identified with a site in the Yoruba town of Esie in north central Nigeria. There, an assemblage of soapstone figures of women, men, and animals were found lying in a forest grove, most showing signs of deliberate damage from an apparent act of organized defacement. It is not known when the objects were created or vandalized, although it is estimated that they were carved between the twelfth and fifteenth century. The disarray of the site has limited attempts to provide dates and establish the cultural origins of these works, however, and even the best estimations remain informed speculation.This sculpted head possesses many traits common to Esie figures, including sharply defined almond eyes, ears set far back on the head, and three protruding scarification marks beside its left eye. While some statues from Esie have been described as solemn in expression, here the mouth seems to part in a slight but gentle smile. The sculptor has given particular attention to the woman's elaborate coiffure, which is almost as large as her head and provides a lively contrast to it.This fragmentary head was originally part of a full-sized figural sculpture. All Esie figures' heads are disproportionately large in relation to their bodies, a visual emphasis also common in the sculptural traditions of Ife, with which they have sometimes been compared. As in the arts of many African peoples, this visual accenting of the head was undoubtedly intended to reflect the importance accorded to it by the culture.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/312519/673676/main-image,Authentic
Royal Seat (Lupona): Female Caryatid,19th century,Luba or Hemba peoples,"Wood, metal studs",H. 24 × W. 11 × D. 11 in. (61 × 27.9 × 27.9 cm),Wood-Furniture,1979.290,"In many cultures throughout the southeastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo—indeed, throughout much of Africa—the seats of leaders are important symbols of power and authority. Among the Luba, rank and title are indicated by the progressive ascension to more prestigious forms of seating, beginning with simple woven mats and proceeding onto animal pelts, clay thrones, and finally, sculpted wooden thrones such as this example from the Museum's collection. Stools figure prominently in the rigorous rites of royal investiture as Luba kings and chiefs accede to power and acquire the appropriate symbols of office. The main function of the stool was not to serve as a seat, but rather as a receptacle for the chief's spirit. Stools are such powerful emblems of a chief's power and identity that they were often kept secretly in a village different from their possessor's to reduce the risk of theft or desecration. The stools, swathed in white cloth and fastidiously guarded, were brought out only on rare occasions, reinforcing the notion that they and their insignia were not intended for human eyes, but rather for those of the spirit world. Among the Luba, all royal stools are considered replicas of an original prototype that was given to their first king, Mbidi Kiluwe, at the time of his investiture.The seat of this royal Luba stool is supported by a standing female figure who balances it on her head and the tips of her elongated fingers. Her small, pear-shaped body is detailed with elaborate cicatrization markings on the stomach and abdomen that, in past generations, enhanced a woman's body as signs of beauty and civilization. Despite being a patriarchal society, the Luba peoples trace succession and inheritance through the female line. Consequently, caryatid figures that support chiefs' stools generally depict female ancestors. This Luba sculptural tradition was designed to identify and glorify the king, chiefs, and titled officials who constituted the complex hierarchy of leadership within the Luba empire.Within this tradition of royal Luba artifacts, the styles of a few artists have come to be recognized and singled out. This Luba chief's ceremonial stool has been attributed to the Buli Master, one of the best-known sculptors of traditional African art, who was named by European scholars after a village in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a number of his works were collected. The stool is part of a corpus of about twenty stylistically related works. Many of these entered European collections around 1900, and it is believed that the Buli Master was active in the middle to late nineteenth century.The Buli Master has been recognized for his ability to imbue his works with particular emotional intensity. Other formal characteristics of the Buli Master's corpus include enlarged, flattened hands turned palm forward; a heavy, four-lobed coiffure crisply undercut at the back of the neck; and an expressive, mournful face. With its slightly aquiline nose, arching brows, and pursed lips, the face wears an expression often interpreted as suffering by Western viewers. The entire sculpture, carved of a single piece of soft wood, is now covered with a lustrous patina, the result of multiple applications of oil to the stool's surface.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/314034/666933/main-image,Authentic

The graphic composition constitutes an eloquent statement concerning the distinct and yet complementary roles of male and female partners as a unit of life. With understated elegance and an economy of details, the artistic distills man and woman to a perfectly integrated and harmonious union. One of the most striking aspects of  the representation is the degree of bilateral symmetry that describes man and woman as reflections of each other with delicate and subtle departures that indicate their distinct identities. The figures' elongated bodies are depicted as a series of parallel vertical lines traversed by horizontals that draw them together.

Seated Chief (Mwanangana) Playing Sanza,19th century (before 1869),Chokwe,"Wood (uapaca), cloth, fiber, beads, dyes, resinous coating",H. 16 3/4 in. × W. 5 in. × D. 5 1/2 in. (42.5 × 12.7 × 14 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1988.157,"By the early nineteenth century, Chokwe chiefs in the savanna of present-day Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola had become active trading partners with merchants from Europe and the New World. Profiting from commerce in ivory, rubber, wax, and African slaves, they emerged as important regional rulers whose prestige and power was reflected in the art they commissioned for their courts at this time.This figure depicts a Chokwe chief, or mwanangana, and epitomizes the balance of power and refinement that is characteristic of Chokwe court art. His large, spreading hands, muscular shoulders, and aggressive posture epitomize the strength and vigor of a ruler. A bulging, domelike forehead and large eyes suggest mental acuity and keen eyesight. The sweeping curves and swelling volumes of the distinctive headdress, rendered here in wood, depict an actual Chokwe crown made of cloth-covered basketry. Horns of the tiny duiker antelope, which bear associations with hunting and the dangerous, mysterious practices of medicine and sorcery, are placed on the sides of the headdress. The chief holds a lamellophone, or ""thumb piano,"" an instrument whose music often accompanies recitations of oral histories and the praise songs of important individuals. Instrument in hand, the chief is cast as a repository and guardian of historical and cultural knowledge.While depicting a nineteenth-century Chokwe chief, this sculpture also evokes the culture hero Chibinda Ilunga, a legendary hunter from the powerful Luba kingdom.

Head of an Oba,16th century,Edo artist,Brass,H.  9 1/4 x W. 8 5/8 x D. 9 in. (23.5 x 21.9 x 22.9 cm),Metal-Sculpture,1979.206.86,"This commemorative cast-brass sculpture depicts the idealized likeness of an oba, or king, wearing a woven cap of coral beads, with lateral strands of coral suspended around both ears. A single bead extends from the headdress to the forehead, aligned with the ridge of the nose, creating bilateral symmetry. The youthful face is round and rendered with precise naturalism. A rolled collar is worn low on the neck and is characteristic of imagery associated with Benin rulers. A circular opening at the summit of the head would have accommodated a carved elephant tusk. This sculpture would have held a place of honor on an altar in the palace of the kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria), during the early half of the sixteenth century.The obas of Benin trace their origins to a ruling dynasty that began in the fourteenth century. The title of oba is passed on to the firstborn son at the time of the ruler’s death. The first obligation of the new king was to create a shrine, dedicated to his predecessor and serving as the site at which the living monarch communicated with his ancestor or father. Ensuring dynastic continuity, the shrine held various carved and cast artifacts, including freestanding brass heads such as this one. The head acted as a vessel through which the late king transferred his power to the new king, the latter accepting the responsibility for successfully directing and defining his life. The Edo people considered the head to be the locus of a man’s character, knowledge, authority, success, and family leadership. These sculptural heads were a consistent visual point of reference from ruler to ruler, reinforcing the idea of familial succession across a single dynasty. The oba is often called by his praise name “Great Head,” emphasizing the head of the living leader as the center of responsibility for the kingdom. Brass heads of the first half of the sixteenth century, such as this one, are distinguished by their naturalism and by the thin walls of their brass casting. The relatively minimal amount of brass used to make this light cast and the proportionately small amount of regalia depicted indicated that the head was created early on. Art historians have suggested that over the centuries, as greater quantities of brass became available, casters had less incentive to be economical with the material, and the trappings of office worn by the kings of Benin became more ostentatious.This genre of commemorative portraiture is highly stylized and does not portray recognizable facial features, but rather renders the deceased king at the prime of his life. The focus is on the regalia and materials of kingship: both brass and coral were items of wealth obtained by Benin’s leadership from Europe through the coastal trade. Coral is of particular significance to the Edo as a metaphor for the ancestral realm of the sea. The use of brass for commemorative heads dates to the fifteenth century, as a way for the Oranmiyan Dynasty rules to distinguish themselves from the previous dynasty of rules. During this time, artists of Benin in dialogue with their patrons developed a sculptural program for commemoration in which the depiction of the oba went from representational to idealization, reinforcing the continuity of the dynasty and its identification with a consistent ideal of leadership. Even today, the Edo value brass for its red color and shiny surface, which make it both beautiful and frightening, properties befitting the images of divine monarchs. Beyond aesthetic qualities, the use of brass conferred on the works a sense of permanence and imbued them with the potential to deflect evil.BibliographyBarley, Nigel.The Art of Benin.

Not every Hemba chief was honored with such a depiction. Such commissions were divinely sanctioned when a sitting chief was visited in a dream by one of his predecessors and this was interpreted as a sign that a singiti figure should be carved in that individual’s honor. Hemba artists emphasized two bodily passages of such representations – the head as the site of one’s intellect where knowledge is taken in through the eyes and the stomach where the umbilicus is the point of connection with one’s extended lineage. A Hemba chief inherited a series of such works that were housed in a dedicated structure centrally located in the community adjacent to his residence.

Memorial Head (Nsodie),ca. 1800,Akan,Terracotta,H. 7 3/4 × W. 6 × D. 7 in. (19.7 × 15.2 × 17.8 cm),Ceramics-Sculpture,2015.790,"This elegant terracotta head is a memorial portrait (nsodie) of an Akan ruler from present-day southern Ghana. It is an idealized representation whose serene expression and well-balanced features suggest the positive qualities such rulers are expected to embody. Created posthumously, royal images like this one were placed with the portraits of previous rulers in sacred areas within the cemetery called asensie. Generally, each royal figure was accompanied by sculptures of courtiers and servants, perhaps to provide aid and comfort to the deceased in the afterlife. Together, they formed sculptural assemblages that honored and preserved the memory of these respected individuals and the chiefly lineages of which they were part. At certain times of the year, the asensie was the focus of prayers, libations, and other offerings that ensured the continuing support and protection of the ancestors.Sculptures associated with this tradition, which dates to at least the seventeenth century, were produced in a wide variety of regional styles.  Like other commemorative sculptures in clay created by artists in the Twifo-Heman traditional area, this reflective portrait is characterized by its serene and meditative expression. Its volumetric and circular head is personalized through distinctive individualized details: cicatrices adorning the temples and an elaborate coiffure. The face’s features are symmetrically defined on either side of the straight ridge of the nose, terminated by slightly flared nostrils that seem to vibrate with life. Striated raised eyebrows interrupt a smooth forehead and arch over shut eyes, defined by a central slit marking each eyelid. The thin-lipped mouth stretches in a small smile that animates the face and adds to its overall sense of serenity. Rows of five vertical cicatrices adorn each temple. Semi-circular ears extend on both sides of the face. This work provides a study of the contrasts between the refined simplicity of the reflective face and the exquisite elaboration of the highly personalized coiffure. In this multi-teared coiffure, each lock has been exploited as an opportunity for abstract formal exploration.Comparing this individualized representation with the other example from the same region in the Met's collection (1978.412.563) reveals the genre of nuanced details implemented by artists to differentiate one individual from another. Indeed, accounts of the creation of Akan memorial heads suggest that the artist, selected by the family, studied the subject in repeated sittings during his or her lifetime.In much of Africa, clay is an artistic medium primarily associated with women. European visitors to this region in the mid-nineteenth century documented a related Akan tradition of lifesize funerary sculpture crafted by female artists. Although earlier accounts did not identify the producers of these smaller memorial heads, it is probable that they were created by female sculptors as well.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/320598/680666/main-image,Authentic
Plaque: Warrior and Attendants,16th–17th century,Edo,Brass,H. 18 3/4 × W. 15 × D. 4 1/4 in. (47.6 × 38.1 × 10.8 cm),Metal-Sculpture,1990.332,"During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a remarkable series of works were created to adorn the exterior of the royal palace in Benin City. A seventeenth-century Dutch visitor to the court of Benin, Olfert Dapper, described the sprawling palace complex—with its many large courtyards and galleries—as containing wooden pillars covered from top to bottom with rectangular cast brass plaques. These plaques are understood to have autonomous meaning and to tell complex narratives in relationship to one another. At some point the plaques were removed from the palace facade, as they were no longer there when the British arrived in the region. One scholar has surmised that they ""were kept like a card index…, and referred to when there was a dispute about courtly etiquette.""The authors of such works were far more concerned with the communication of hierarchies and status than in capturing individual physical features. These plaques conform to a convention of ""hierarchical proportions"" wherein the largest figure is the one with the greatest authority and rank. In this example, it is a warrior chief. He is in the center, flanked on either side by soldiers of lesser rank. Regalia and symbols of status are emphasized above all other aspects of the subject depicted. For example, the warrior is shown with leopard-spot scarification marks and a leopard-tooth necklace, which associate him with the stealth, speed, and ferocity of the leopard. As ""king of the bush,"" the leopard is one of the principle symbols of Benin kingship. Additionally, the warrior chief wears a coral-studded helmet and collar, a lavish wrap, and a brass ornament on his hip. In his left hand he carries a ceremonial sword, a gesture of honor and loyalty, and holds a spear in his other hand.The servile status of the figures flanking the warrior chief is indicated by the objects they carry. One attendant has a fan used to cool the warrior chief, the other a trumpet to announce his presence. A third attendant brings a box containing an offering of kola nuts for theoba(king).The Legacy of Benin Court Art: From Tragedy to ResilienceAt its origins, the centralized city-state of Benin was founded by Edo-speaking peoples. The accounts by official court historians and descriptions provided by visitors evoke a vibrant cultural center continually redefined by its leadership through shifting internal and external power dynamics.

This shift was manifest in the increased emphasis on the oba’s ceremonial and ritual activities and the aggrandizement of chiefly residences that outstripped the palace. Concurrently significant changes were unfolding around Benin: Islam was in the ascendant in the rival state of Oyo; Christianity was embraced by the southern Yoruba; abolition of the slave trade was leading to the demise of the Itsekiri monarchy; and local British officials were increasingly determined to undermine the oba’s authority.The British invasion of the capital of the Kingdom of Benin in 1897 was part of a campaign waged from 1892 through 1902 to forcibly bring most of the inland territory of modern-day Nigeria under British rule. With the British conquest of Benin City, Oba Ovonramwen was exiled to Calabar and soldiers plundered the palace. The brutality of the removal of its contents has forever decoupled altars dedicated to each individual oba dating from 1300 to Benin’s conquest with the specific works conceived to commemorate them. Directly following the military action some 200 Benin artifacts were given to the British Museum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs while others were sold on the international art market. In addition to dealers and private collectors the major clientele at this time were newly established ethnographic museums in the West. Following Ovonramwen’s death in 1913, his son Eweka II was restored to the office within a British protectorate and prioritized a renewal of artistic patronage in Benin City. Subsequent to the nineteenth century dispersal of Benin works, awareness of their extraordinary aesthetic power, beauty, and complexity profoundly influenced Black public intellectuals. Notable among these in the U.S. were W.E.B. Dubois, Alain Locke and artists from the Harlem Renaissance on. At the same time, their relegation to ethnographic museums during the colonial era continues to reflect the legacy of their forceful removal and segregation from comparable cultural achievements by Western creators.In 1950 a selection of Benin works were transferred through sale, exchange, and donation from the British Museum to what is today Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments for display in Benin City and Lagos. In 1960 with the establishment of the Federation of Nigeria as a nation, Benin City became the capital of Edo State. Exemplars of this tradition today conserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were given to this institution in 1969 and 1991 by individuals who acquired them on the international art market to at once make them accessible to the public and celebrate their excellence. In 2016 Oba Ewuare II assumed the title of Benin’s current oba. He has noted that while such works ""have come to serve as ambassadors of our culture around the world,"" a priority is the building of a new museum devoted to this legacy in Benin City. Designed by David Adjaye, this major cultural initiative embedded in the very fabric of the ancient city walls promises to afford expanded opportunities to understand and reflect on the significance of this living tradition at its source as well as those for international collaboration.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/316393/666922/main-image,Authentic
Male Power Figure (Nkisi),late19th–mid-20th century,Kongo,"Wood, pigment, nails, cloth, beads, shells, arrows, leather, nuts, twine",H. 23 1/8 x D. 10 1/4 x W. 10 in. (58.8 x 26 x 25.4 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1979.206.127,"This work was the product of an intense collaboration between a sculptor and the initiated priest ""nganga,"" who controlled its use in his professional practice. After an artist completed carving the artifact, the ""nganga"" transformed it into an object capable of healing illness, settling disputes, safeguarding the peace, and punishing wrongdoers. Each work of this kind or ""nkisi"" is associated with a spirit, that is subjected to a degree of human control. The term ""nkisi"" may relate to a wide spectrum of physical receptacles, including cloth packets, filled vessels, as well as the carved wood sculptures studied by art historians. This piece is especially admired for its reflective inward expression.Among the many amulets and bound bundles attached to this ""nkisi,"" are a finely carved anthropomorphic cross and a small gong. The cross alludes to the division between the land of the living and the land of the dead and represents the meeting place of these two worlds, or the ""crossroads."" The gong and other musical instruments of this type are believed to sound in the land of the dead and are therefore used to call the spirit of the ""nkisi."" The ""nkisi's"" power is further enhanced by the addition of two miniature ""minkisi,"" one with a cowry embedded in its stomach and the other encrusted with a thick layer of medicines.Cloth and tied bundles, like those seen in abundance on this ""nkisi,"" have multiple interpretations. Knots and the act of tying are associated with the binding and capturing of a spirit. Additionally, cloth as a cherished commodity represents a generous financial offering made to the ""nkisi"" in gratitude for its assistance. Finally, cloth taken from intimate garments seals the connection between a supplicant and the ""nkisi.""This nkisi has been a highlight of the Rockefeller collection since its acquisition in 1952.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/312342/683036/restricted,Authentic
Illuminated Gospel,late 14th–early 15th century,Amhara peoples,"Parchment (vellum), wood (acacia), tempera, ink",H. 16 1/2 x W. 11 1/4 x D. 4 in. (41.9 x 28.6 x 10.2 cm),Hide-Documents,1998.66,"This illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels was created at a monastic center in northern Ethiopia. Twenty full-page paintings depict scenes from the life of Christ and four portraits of the evangelists introduce the respective Gospel texts. The New Testament was translated from Greek into Geez, the classical language of Ethiopia, in the sixth century. Both this text and its pictorial format draw upon Byzantine prototypes, which were transformed into a local idiom of expression. Stylistically consistent, the paintings reflect the hands of two distinct artists. The color scheme consists of red, yellow, green, and blue. A stylized uniformity is reflected in the abbreviated definition of facial features and the bold linear articulation of the human form in black and red. Figures' heads are depicted frontally, their bodies often in profile. Bodies are treated as columnar masses encased in textiles composed of striated fields juxtaposed against one another.This work is evidence of sub-Saharan Africa's historically complex interrelationships with Arabia, Egypt, and the eastern Mediterranean. The origins of civilization in Highlands Ethiopia can be traced to the sixth century B.C.E., when emigrants from Arabia merged with indigenous groups to develop the kingdom of Aksum. In the fourth century C.E., scholars from Alexandria converted the Ethiopian king Ezana, and Christianity became the official religion of a state that endured until modern times. Over the centuries, as the Ethiopian state expanded, monasteries were founded as centers of learning responsible for disseminating knowledge and consolidating the power and influence of the monarchy. In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the text of the Gospels was considered the most important holy writing; the miniatures at the beginning of this manuscript were intended to be viewed during liturgical processions. Such works were frequently presented to churches by distinguished patrons; they reflected both the prestige of royal benefactors and the erudition of the monastic scriptoria in which they were created.  Recent research suggests that a member of Ethiopia's ruling elite may have commissioned this manuscript at Dabra Hayg Estifanos monastery for presentation to his or her favored church or monastery.  Brief notations indicate that the church in question was dedicated to the Archangel Michael.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/317618/662880/main-image,Authentic
Seated figure,13th century,Middle Niger civilization,Terracotta,H. 10 × W. 9 3/4 × D. 11 3/4 in. (25.4 × 24.8 × 29.8 cm),Ceramics-Sculpture,1981.218,"This haunting figure huddles with its leg hugged to its chest and its head dropped on its knee. It simultaneously suggests the knotted tension of anxiety and the sublime absorption of deep prayer. Created over 700 years ago, in the Inland Niger Delta region of present-day Mali, this elegant work's intense emotional immediacy blurs the boundaries of time and place.This terracotta sculpture comes from a site called Jenne-jeno, the oldest known city in sub-Saharan Africa. Jenne-jeno flourished in the ninth century A.D., but declined and was abandoned by 1400. Items of cast brass and forged iron, clay vessels, and figures like this one survive. They testify to what scholars contend was a richly varied and highly sophisticated urban society.A few controlled archaeological digs provide only the vaguest outlines of the original significance of the art of this time and region. Recovered terracotta figures are frequently quite detailed. They include jewelry, clothing, and body ornaments such as the parallel columns of bumps and circles on the back of this work. Sometimes they cover the entire body and seem to represent the pustules of some dreadful illness.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/314362/666906/main-image,Authentic

(76.8 x 33 x 22.9 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1978.412.489,"Throughout the twentieth century, members of poro, a Senufo initiation association, wore small, finely carved face masks as insignia. The masks, known as kpeliye'e, feature delicate oval faces with geometric projections at the sides. Raised and incised scarification patterns ornament their smooth, glossy surfaces. Considered feminine, the masks honor deceased Senufo elders with their grace and beauty. They provide a complement to the aggressive Senufo helmet masks also sponsored by fraternal organizations in the region. The feathers and animal horns attached to this example are unusual, and may have reflected its owner's power to counteract negative forces in the community.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/310950/666912/restricted,Authentic
Priest with raised arms,14th–17th century,Dogon peoples,"Wood, patina",H. 82 7/8 x W. 14 1/4 x D. 8 3/8 in. (210.5 x 36.2 x 21.3 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1978.412.322,"The Dogon live in the elevated rocky heights of Mali's Bandiagara Escarpment. They rely on agriculture and manage to wrest subsistence crops from poor soil in an area that receives little rain. This monumental figure is one of the largest Dogon sculptures known. The region's dry climate has preserved Dogon works far longer than is usual for African wood sculpture, and radiocarbon testing of this work suggests that it may date as far back as the fifteenth century.Dogon sculpture is primarily concerned with the spirits responsible for the fertility of both land and people. These include a family's real and mythical ancestors, the souls of women who died in childbirth, and water spirits. While the exact functions and meanings of individual works often remain obscure, scholars agree that Dogon sculptures were created for shrines.The most distinctive subject rendered by Dogon sculptures is that of a single figure standing with raised arms. This posture has usually been interpreted as a gesture of prayer—an effort to link earth and heavens—and it has been suggested that it may represent an appeal for rain. This masterpiece of Dogon figurative art depicts a man with a well-modeled body in a naturalistic stance. The artist has carefully rendered the figure's musculature, anatomical detail, and body ornament. His stylized beard identifies him as an elder and an individual whose age and experience entitle him to participate in the most important religious, political, and social affairs of Dogon society. The figure wears wristlets, armlets, and anklets that indicate his status, as well as a belt and neck pendants resembling leather talismans that also suggest his spiritual importance.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/310765/1297303/main-image,Authentic
Wunkirmian or wakemia feasting spoon,19th–mid-20th century,Dan,"Wood, pigment",H. 3 1/8 × W. 3 1/2 × D. 18 1/4 in. (7.9 × 8.9 × 46.4 cm),Wood-Implements,1979.206.264,"Artists in Dan communities of Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire have mastered the art of carving impressive wooden ladles that are virtuoso works of sculpture. These ceremonial ladles, known aswunkirmianorwakemia(which translates as ""spoon associated with feasts"") are badges of prestige acknowledging an individual woman for her incomparable generosity. Oversized (they can measure up to two feet), they are not so much utilitarian objects as symbols of status and the bearer of spiritual powers. Quality of craftsmanship and complexity of design are constitutive of the work’s importance.To create such esteemed objects, Dan sculptors often rely on anthropomorphic forms and draw upon elements of style developed in other carvings such as masks and figures. This arresting example presents a wonderful abstraction of the human form: its handle depicts the lower half of a female body while its bowl symbolically replaces the body’s upper part. Here, the artist has combined anatomical preciseness with stylization that draws attention to certain idealized bodily attributes. The handle’s solid, rounded forms suggest vigor and productiveness. The robust calves attest to the ability to work hard and give the impression of youth. Youth is associated with the notion of fertility, a significant cultural ideal. The carver has represented the legs slightly spread apart and bent, adding dynamism to the composition. Similarly, the feet are delicately extended at different angles, suggesting movement. Circular disks accentuate the position of the knees repeating curvilinear forms. The intricacy of the work and the sculptor's attention to detail is evident in the articulated toes and the embellishments of beautifying markings on the surface of the slender thighs. Both the smooth concave surface and the hatched convex side recall images of luminous adorned skin. At the center of the ladle, a fluted narrow form links handle to bowl and allows for a harmonious transition between two contrasting elements.Depiction of legs are not the most common anthropomorphic feature carved as a ladle’s handle: more frequent are handles representing the likeness of a human head (such as the other example of Danwunkirmianin the Met’s collection,1979.206.254). Other variations include  representations of a human hand, animal heads such as goats or cow, small bowls, and a variety of abstract designs. According to paramount chief Woto Mongru of Kanple interviewed by Barbara Johnson in 1983, legs, when chosen to be featured as the ladle’s handle, represent all the people arriving on foot to be fed by its owner (Johnson 1987, 20); the bowl, rounded and lustrous, symbolizes the womb of the ladle's spirit 'pregnant' with rice.Emblematic of honor and status,wunkirmianare the possession of thewunkirleorwakede, ""at feasts acting woman."" A title of great distinction, it is given to the most hospitable woman of a village quarter. German art historian Hans Himmelheber, together with Wowoa Tame-Tabmen, has best described the role of thewunkirlein an article dedicated to the topic (Himmelheber and Tabmen 1965). One woman in each village quarter is honored with the title ofwunkirle. When awunkirlebecomes old she chooses her successor from among the young women of her quarter (Johnson 1987, 17) and passes down herwunkirmian. With the honor comes a lot of responsibility— thewunkirlemust be of a generous disposition, gladly offering her hospitality to anyone at any time, organizing and providing for important meals, and feeding travelers. In order to be able to afford this largess, thewunkirlemust be successful and industrious, and a well accomplished farmer.In addition to being emblems of honor,wunkirmianalso hold spiritual power (Himmelheber and Tabmen 1965, 177). They are a Dan woman's chief liaison with the power of the spirit world and a symbol of that connection. In the words of awunkirle, Doa, the ladles contain ""all the power and fame of thewunkirle"" (Johnson 1987, 19). Among the Dan, thewunkirmianhave been assigned a role among women that is comparable to that which masks serve among the men. As are masks, eachwunkirmianis given an individual name. When a newwunkirmianis carved to replace an old one, sacrifices are made to empower it. In many instances,wunkirmianare featured in the same ceremonies with masks, tossing rice in front of them as a blessing while they proceed through the village.In that context, one of thewunkirle’s responsibilities is preparing the large feast that accompanies masquerade ceremonies. The excellent farming abilities, organizational talents, and culinary skills of thewunkirleare called upon to properly welcome and celebrate the masquerade spirits. When a woman has been selected as the main hostess of such a feast, she parades through town carrying the large ladle as an emblem of her status. She is followed by a line of women from her quarter, each carrying a pot of cooked rice or soup. With help from her numerous assistants (usually female relatives or friends), she distributes grains and coins to the children of the community while dancing and singing. The event creates a profound visual analogy that honors the hostess, and women in general, as a source of food and life.In 1926, a young Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966) reinterpreted the Dan equation between a woman’s womb and the bowl of a spoon in his sculptureSpoon Woman(Femme Cuillère). Like many artists of his generation, he was familiar with and admired the bold reinterpretations of the human body imagined and expressed by artists from West and Central Africa that had begun to fill the Parisian artists’ ateliers during the first decade of the 20th century. In this life-size bronze sculpture, considered among his earliest mature works, the artist uses the premise established by Dan carvers as a point of departure, but pushes the form further towards geometric abstraction.Yaëlle Biro, 2016Further readingFischer, E. and H.

Gwandansu,15th–17th century,Bamana,"Wood (Cordyla africana or Lonchocarpus), applied organic materials",H. 48 1/4 × W. 12 3/4 × D. 13 1/4 in. (122.6 × 32.4 × 33.7 cm),Wood-Sculpture,1979.206.121,"Bamana notions of ideal beauty and character are evoked in this figure of a mother and child. The figure is part of a corpus of large, relatively naturalistic sculptures whose rounded volumes and variety of gestures depart from the angular forms and stiff postures characteristic of many other types of Bamana sculpture. These figures are displayed at the annual ceremonies of ""Jo"", an association of initiated Bamana men and women, and at the rituals of ""Gwan"", a related society whose purpose is to help women conceive and bear children. Groups of sculptures which were collectively owned by individual communities to be publicly exhibited on such occasions, included representations of a mother and child, a male companion, and related attendant figures.This figure depicts a woman of extraordinary abilities, as shown by the amulet-laden hat she wears and the knife strapped to her left arm, both of which are conventionally associated with the powers of male hunters. An even more vital message conveyed by the sculpture is the importance of motherhood in maintaining social cohesion and continuity within Bamana society, and elders' roles in passing on their skills, powers, and values to future generations.",https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/312336/2173406/restricted,Authentic
